## Hook scripts plugin for Serverless
Kenneth Falck <kennu@iki.fi> 2016

This plugin lets you easily create shell or node script hooks that are run whenever
Serverless actions are executed.

## Installation

First install the plugin into your Serverless project:

    npm install --save serverless-plugin-hookscripts

Then edit your **s-project.json**, locate the plugins: [] section, and add
the plugin as follows:

    plugins: [
        "serverless-plugin-hookscripts"
    ]

## Configuration

Use the "hookscripts create" command to create sample hook scripts in the *s-hooks*
folder of your project root.

To enable a shell script hook, remove the ".sample" extension of the generated script.
To enable a node script hook, create a .js file that exports a function handler for the hook.

To understand all the hooks, you may need to refer to the Serverless source code
at https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/actions.

## Shell Script: Event data

The data in event.options is made available to the shell scripts in two ways:

* As command line arguments in the form of: --region regionName
* As environment variables in the form of: SLS_HOOK_REGION=regionName

Simple data types (strings and numbers) are passed on as they are.
Complex data types (objects, arrays, etc) are encoded in JSON format.

## Node Script

Create a .js file that exports a function handler for the hook.
NOTE: the function must return a promise that resolves a hook event object just like a normal hook would

The handler function is passed 2 arguments:
1. __S__: the ServerlessPlugin Class
2. __evt__: the hook event object

For example:
```
module.exports = function(S, evt) {
  // your hook code here

  return Promise.resolve(evt);
};
```
